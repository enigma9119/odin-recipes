    <h2 class="subheading"><span>Description</span></h2>
    <p>
      Blend roasted broccoli, cream cheese, and vegetable broth to make a
      simple, yet delicious soup. Roasting broccoli enhances its flavor,
      allowing nutty and sweet flavors to develop.

    <h2 class="subheading"><span>Ingredients</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups chopped broccoli florets and stalks</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
      <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>Â¾ teaspoon lemon pepper, or more as needed</li>
      <li>crushed red pepper flakes to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="subheading"><span>Steps</span></h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place broccoli, onion, garlic, and olive oil in a large bowl and toss to
        coat evenly. Place on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast vegetables until soft, 30 to 35 minutes, stirring every 10
        minutes. Remove from oven. Chop 1/4 cup of broccoli florets; set aside
        for garnish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine remaining vegetables with vegetable broth, cream cheese, and
        lemon pepper in a high-powered blender or food processor in batches.
        Puree soup until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour soup into a saucepan over medium-low heat until warmed through,
        about 5 minutes. Season with additional lemon pepper to taste. Ladle
        into bowls. Garnish with reserved chopped broccoli and crushed red
        pepper.
      </li>
